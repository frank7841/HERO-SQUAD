# Hero Squad
##### Frankline SImiyu

## Description
Hero Squad is a Web App  that allows users who interact with it to create heroes and squads/alliances that contain a particular number of heroes such as Marvel's Avengers or DC's Justice League. Heroes can be affiliated with only 1 squad at a single time, therefore if the hero was to switch to another group, their name should not be present in the previous squad that they were in

##### Hero & Squad Properties
During the creation of a new hero/squad, these are the traits that they should contain.

| Hero properties  | Squad properties |
| :----: |:----:|
| Name | Name |
